# Terraform Registry

The [Terraform Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) is an interactive resource for discovering a wide selection of integrations (Providers) and configuration packages (Modules) for use with Terraform. The Registry includes solutions developed by HashiCorp, Third-party vendors, and those created by our Terraform community. The Registry aims to connect our users with solutions, and to help new users get started with Terraform more quickly, by sharing examples of how Terraform is written, and find pre-made modules for infrastructure components you require.

The Terraform Registry is integrated [directly into Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/docs/configuration/providers.html) to make consuming Providers and modules easy. Anyone can publish both Providers and Modules on the Terraform Registry â€“ you may use the [Public Registry](https://registry.terraform.io) for viewing public providers and modules; For private modules, you can use a [Private Registry](https://www.terraform.io/docs/registry/private.html), or [reference repositories and other sources directly](https://www.terraform.io/docs/modules/sources.html).

Use the navigation to the left to learn more about using the registry.
